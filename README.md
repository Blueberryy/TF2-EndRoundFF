# Installation:

1.) Download a zip of the repository or each individual file and drag and drop them into addons/sourcemod.

2.) (Optional) Edit the translations file to set the messages to your liking. Don't alter the {1} value as that is a variable for changing the text to enabled/disabled.

3.) Load the plugin using sm plugins load endroundff, changing the map or restarting your server.

4.) The plugin automatically generates a config file named endroundff.cfg in cfg/sourcemod, you can modify the ConVars in the file. If you change any ConVar values in the config, remember to reload the plugin afterwards with sm plugins reload endroundff!

5.) (Optional) Install updater (https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=169095) to have the plugin automatically update.
